# Q-Craft Custom Model Data
This is a resource pack created for the Q-Craft SMP allowing them to add custom items and models to the game without having to mod the game using Minecraft's [Custom Model Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrFMdcjonyo) feature.

Development versions can be downloaded by clicking the green `<> Code` button, then select download ZIP. These versions may contain unused or broken models, use at your own peril. 

Versions used on the server can be obtained in [Releases](https://github.com/adammakesfilm/qcraft-custom-model-data/releases) on the right hand column. Select the most recent version, and download the ZIP. Put that downloaded ZIP file into your resource pack folder and enable it on Minecraft. **You do not need to unzip the pack.**
