# Q-Craft Custom Model Data
This is a resource pack created for the Q-Craft SMP allowing them to add custom items and models to the game without having to mod the game using Minecraft's [Custom Model Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrFMdcjonyo) feature.

To use, click the green `<> Code` button, then select download ZIP. Put that ZIP file into your resource pack folder and enable it on Minecraft. You do not need to unzip the pack.
